## Run
To run the application, clone the repository, open the terminal in the `bin` folder, and execute the command `java application/Program`

## Demo

The game starts with the white pieces, and the moves are indicated by the squares of the pieces

The game is already programmed to prevent illegal moves, it is robust against errors, it monitors rounds, and keeps track of captured pieces
